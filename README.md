## Xi-Smartwatch
# Brought to yo by the Xi Class of Theta Tau

The smartwatch is a touch screen device with two simple apps and one complex app.

Our two simple apps are a clock function that has a timer and stopwatch, and our second app
is a dice rolling app that gives you a randomized number.

Our complex app is a fitness tracker that tracks our steps and calculates the distance that you
traveled.

The class has worked hard to put this all together and although this is a new experience for
a lot of us in Theta Tau the challenge of this is what brought us together. There were ups and
downs but in the end we brought it together and bring you this masterpiece.
